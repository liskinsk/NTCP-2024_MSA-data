This site contains two Supplemental files associated with the manuscript "Amino acid substitutions at rheostat positions in the NTCP channel have pleiotropic effects" by Swint-Kruse, Ruggiero, and Hagenbuch.  This manuscript is currently under review.

The multiple sequence alignment of homologs in the SLC10A1 family of transport proteins was created using ConSurf (https://consurf.tau.ac.il/consurf_index.php) from the parameters described in the Methods of the manuscript "Amino acid substitutions at rheostat positions in the NTCP channel have pleiotropic effects" by Swint-Kruse, Ruggiero, and Hagenbuch.  This manuscript is currently under review.
