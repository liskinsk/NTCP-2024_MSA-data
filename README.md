# NTCP-2025-MSA and data
This site contains two Supplemental files associated with the manuscript "Amino acid substitutions at rheostat positions in the NTCP channel have pleiotropic effects" by Swint-Kruse, Ruggiero, and Hagenbuch.  Please cite:  Swint-Kruse L,
Ruggiero MJ, Hagenbuch B. Amino acid substitutions at rheostat positions in the Na+/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide substrate channel have pleiotropic effects. Protein Science.2025;34(11):e70313. https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.70313

The multiple sequence alignment of homologs in the SLC10A1 family of transport proteins was created using ConSurf (https://consurf.tau.ac.il/consurf_index.php) from the parameters described in the Methods.

The excel file contains the measurements for cellular substrate uptake and surface expression for substitutions at positions 102, 146, 267, and 271 in human NTCP.  This file also contains computations for abundance-normalized transport for each variant, with error propagation.
